chakra-ros-stacks
---------------

This is a fork of [bchretien](https://github.com/bchretien/arch-ros-stacks)'s fork of [zootboy](https://github.com/zootboy/arch-ros-stacks)'s fork of [hauptmech](https://github.com/hauptmech/arch-ros-stacks)'s fork of [moesenle](https://github.com/moesenle/arch-ros-stacks)'s very nice arch-ros-stacks adapted to Chakra's dependencies.

I am maintaining Hydro packages for Chakra Linux. They have not been uploaded to CCR, since I don't believe there is any demand. Please e-mail me if you want me to upload them or if you have any suggestions, comments or package requests:

### Python version

Starting with Indigo, Python 3 support is added to ROS. However, since most non-core packages are not Python 3 ready yet, we will continue using Python 2 for Indigo.

### How to contribute

If you want to contribute, please do so on [bchretien](https://github.com/bchretien/arch-ros-stacks)'s repo, I will then merge the changes into this repo.
